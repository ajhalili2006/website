Hey, you’re lurking on [my own now page][nowpage-info], where usually tell you
what am I been doing (or if you’re watching TheJuiceMedia videos, cooking
while in lockdown) and what I’m focusing on at this point. I’ll attempt
to keep this updated, at least on bi-monthly basis.
([sneak to my nownownow entry](https://nownownow.com/p/Dxh0) for some tidbits)

## What am I doing/done lately

Horribly busy at senior high school while hauling over [autistic burnout](https://www.spectrumnews.org/news/autistic-burnout-explained/) (alongside some mental
health issues relating to being closeted disabled/ND person, including internalized ableism and ).

Few weeks ago, I'm officially graduated on [Coda Doctorate program](https://coda.io/@maria-marquis/earn-your-coda-doctorate), even through I may have
some docs still unfinished to this day (but hopefully exectuive dysfunctioning don't hit
me like a bus). ([find me on alummi list](https://coda.io/@maria-marquis/coda-doctorate-graduates))

## Where am I?

Currently on our family’s house until at least I can find a job in the future and afford a house to at least rent to.
Currently observing Philippine Standard Time, which if you’re on Eastern Time, my apologies for late replies.

Please do not ask me for my home address if you want to send me some stuff instead of usual handwritten fan mail, I’ll ignore that due to privacy reasons.

## TODOs, any ideas, anything else?

For the personal backlog I can share publicly, please [see my todo.sr.ht tracker](https://todo.sr.ht/~ajhalili2006/ajhalili2006) and [also on GitLab](https://mau.dev/andreijiroh.dev/launchpad/issues).
