Hey, you’re lurking on [my own now page][nowpage-info].
Now pages are usually tell you what am I been doing (or if you’re watching TheJuiceMedia videos, cooking while in lockdown) and what I’m
focusing on at this point. I’ll attempt to keep this updated, at least on bi-monthly basis.

## Where am I?

Currently on our family’s house until at least I can find a job in the future and afford a house to at least rent to.
Currently observing Philippine Standard Time, which if you’re on Eastern Time, my apologies for late replies.

Please do not ask me for my home address if you want to send me some stuff instead of usual handwritten fan mail, I’ll ignore that due to privacy reasons.

## What am I doing lately

Still at AFGBMTS busy doing all things school related, while juggling between personal projects and stuff at [Recap Time Squad](https://recaptime.eu.org).

## TODOs, any ideas, anything else?

For the personal backlog I can share publicly, please [see my todo.sr.ht tracker](https://todo.sr.ht/~ajhalili2006/ajhalili2006).

## Information for employers

Please see [this page in my personal user manual](https://andreijiroh.eu.org/user-manual/job-employment-availability) for details.
