description: What ~ajhalili2006 been doing lately, sometimes behind the scenes.

Hey, you’re lurking on [my own now page][nowpage-info], where usually tell you
what am I been doing (or if you’re watching TheJuiceMedia videos, cooking
while trying not to lose my sanity over PH politics) and what I’m focusing on at this point. I’ll attempt
to keep this updated, at least on bi-monthly basis.
([sneak to my nownownow entry](https://nownownow.com/p/Dxh0) for some tidbits)

## What am I doing/done lately

Currently building technical projects in the public ([see my scrapbook](https://scrapbook.hackclub.com/ajhalili2006)) while participating in
[Hack Club Arcade](https://hackclub.com/arcade) and preparing for the next school year as well.

Some of these include [coding a rewrite of my public `golinks` service](https://github.com/andreijiroh-dev/api-servers/tree/main/apps/golinks-v2)
and even building a CLI tool for managing secrets in a gopass-styled monorepo with `dotenvx`.

## Where am I?

Currently on our family’s house until at least I can find a job in the future and afford a house to at least rent to.
Currently observing Philippine Standard Time, which if you’re on Eastern Time, my apologies for late replies.

Please do not ask me for my home address if you want to send me some stuff instead of usual handwritten fan mail, I’ll ignore that due to privacy reasons.

## TODOs, any ideas, anything else?

For the personal backlog I can share publicly, please [see my todo.sr.ht tracker](https://todo.sr.ht/~ajhalili2006/ajhalili2006) and [also on GitLab](https://mau.dev/andreijiroh-dev/launchpad/issues) and [GitHub](https://github.com/andreijiroh-dev/personal-launchpad/issues).
