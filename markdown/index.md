# Well hello there!

![GitHub readme banner](https://github.com/ajhalili2006/ajhalili2006/raw/83d1552339fec8d91eadcab0289d43b6a9ef775c/static/readme-banner-2022.png)

I'm **Andrei Jiroh Halili** (he/they), an 18 year old Autistic Filipino student, self-taught Node.js developer (in training), open-source contributor,
self-assigned BDFL and lead maintainer at [Recap Time Squad](https://recaptime.dev)[^1],
and part-time blogger for [my personal blog](https://ajhalili2006.substack.com)
and [The Bloody Hell PH](https://fromthebshq.substack.com) based in Marilao, Bulacan, Philippines. I'm passionate about Linux (especially shell scripting and all things
software packaging, currently Alpine Linux package maintainer for GitHub CLI), DevSecOps, programming (not only in JavaScript, but I am also exploring Python, Go and other languages), politics (_cough Philippine politics_) and internet health (things like fandom toxicity and cancel culture).

Currently, I am participating in [Hack Club Arcade](https://hackclub.com/arcade) to work through
my personal projects throughout the first month of my last school year in senior high school.
