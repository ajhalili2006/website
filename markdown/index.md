# Well hello there!

I'm Andrei Jiroh Halili, an future web dev from the Philippines, currently an high school student at day and self-assigned BDFL
and lead open-source maintainer at [Recap Time Squad](https://recaptime.eu.org)[^1]
and writer for my personal blog and The Bloody Hell PH,
sometimes I'm contributing to open-source projects.

It might be not obvious for most of you, but behind the scenes I'm neurodivegent,
specifically [#ActuallyAutistic](https://anagora.org/actuallyautistic)[^2] [^3], so I'm mostly in limited availability,
not only for my mental health.

[^1]: Not an company, as mentioned in my GitHub and GitLab profiles
[^2]: There are many great resources from the autistic community (and also the wider neurodiversity and disability rights community), especially from [Neuroclastic](https://neuroclastic.com/autism-101-resources-from-the-autistic-community/), if you want to be an ally or simply want to help make inclusivity across intersections mainstream.
[^3]: Originally disclosed as [an comment in a r/PH post](https://www.reddit.com/r/Philippines/comments/1117266/comment/j8dgv95/?context=3), although
it's still a work in progress for me to recover from autistic burnout and to unmask.
