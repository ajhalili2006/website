# Well hello there!

I'm ~ajhalili2006 (he/they[^1]) and this is my personal website, statically hosted on [~vern][tilde-vern]
(with [an mirror on ctrl-c.club][tilde-ctrlc] and [tilde-agonistic one] via [CF Pages]). This also serves as an mini personal wiki, although I run
[a wiki over at Miraheze](https://ajhalili2006.miraheze.org) with more content like my user manual, how to
contact me over encrypted lines of communications and other stuff.

[^1]: Technically `he/him/they/them`, although I mostly prefer `they/them`. See [communications section of my user manual](./user-manual/communications.md)
