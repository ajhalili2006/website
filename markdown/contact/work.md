I am currently not open for work at the moment because I am more focused on finishing school and upskilling,
but I am open to receive offers, except that I may slow to reply on them. Sorry if I couldn't reply lately.

## What I am looking for?

* All-remote jobs, as much as possible.
    * If relocation to another country is needed, you should sponsor my costs for passport + visa application, flights and rent.
    * For in-office/onsite work, must be near Marilao, Bulacan.
* Fair wage, should be better than national minimum wage in PH (at least in NCR/Metro Manila region)
* Health insurance, preferably with mental health and therapy coverage.

## You up?
