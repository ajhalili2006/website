# Code reviews and pair programming

[Go back to contact page](./index.md){ .md-button }

---

As a student myself learning JavaScript, I am open to do pair programming to
help improve both of our coding skills and do peer reviews before getting shipped to production.

Read on if you're a good match with me

## What I'm looking for

* Fellow open-source developers in any proficiency in programming languages I use.
    * If it is not on the list, I am more than happy to be paired with you to learn that language together.
    * If you need a helping hand on handling patches and community moderation for your project, I am also in.
* Software developers and engineers building production-grade frontend and backend code, a la apprenticeship or internship.
    * For frontend, I am looking to learn to use Flutter for cross-platform apps instead of learning Electron for desktop apps and React Native for mobile apps.
    * For backend, I want to explore data persistence with Postgres, MySQL and MongoDB, alongside caching with Redis.

## The Rules

* [Follow the personal user manual](../user-manual/index.md)
* All-remote sessions only, no in-person meetings unless part of hiring process/employment and within Bulacan/Metro Manila.
* All communications must be async. For sync meetings, it should be 2 hours max and/or have meeting notes in a Google Doc/GitHub issue/Slack canvas/Canva doc.
* You do not need to pay me up for this, but consider [sponsoring me via GitHub Sponsors](https://github.com/sponsors/ajhalili2006) or
[hire me](./work.md) if you do.
