!!! warning "This page is a working draft"
    I'll be compiling some more answers to frequently asked questions about me in the future. In the meanwhile, if your
    answer is not here, [let me know](./contact/index.md) or
    search the internet.

## Disability and neurodivergence

!!! note "Dive deeper"
    I may expect to get questions about autism in general, so I compile these resources ahead of time.

    * **Personal user manual**: [Neurodivergence and Disability](./user-manual/neurodivergence-and-disability.md)
    * **Community resources**: [Public Neurodiversity Support Center (PNDSC)](https://coda.io/@mykola-bilokonsky/public-neurodiversity-support-center), plus resources at [Awesome Neurodiversity](https://linktr.ee/AwesomeND) list

_This section will be updated as soon as things are being ironed out behind the scenes._

## Personal

### Pronouns?

My pronouns are he/they, but I'm more than welcome to use gender-neutral pronouns instead.

### Can I send you a physical letter or gift?

For privacy reasons, I can't publish my home address for obvious privacy reasons, but
I'll reconsider it in the future. If you still want to, options are:

* covering purchases on my wishlist on [Gift App](https://giftapp.com/ajhalili2006)

## All things free/libre and open-source

### Are you an open-source/free software absolutist?

Not necessary as hard as RMS, though I still have to do my own homework on its culture, among other things like self-hosting and defense in depth in terms of security and privacy.

The only problems here why I can't go full in would be the toxicity of the tech/open-source spaces and the same reason
why you still need to use Windows solely at work (bless anyone setting their dev environments in Windows containers).

### Why haven't you reviewed my merge request or email patch?

By the way, please don't harass me over DMs like Duo for not reviewing your patch (although in case of emergency patches like seucrity-related ones,
please be respectful).

## The Bloody Hell PH

### Do you plan to dig anyone's grave (past in this case) to get them cancelled to hell and back?

Wish I could say no thanks on doing a lot of OSINT, but Twitter's (now X) been a hot mess lately and
while writing every single internet shitfuckery (not just people getting cancelled) costs more spoons than in school while masking hard. Sure, I may cover some of them,
but there's a lot of stuff happening across the interwebs and I can't do the homework alone.
