## Personal

### Pronouns?

My pronouns are he/they, but I'm more than welcome to use gender-neutral pronouns instead.

### Can I send you a physical letter or gift?

For privacy reasons, I can't publish my home address for obvious privacy reasons, but
I'll reconsider it in the future.

## All things free/libre and open-source

### Are you an open-source/free software absolutist?

Not necessary as hard as RMS, though I still have to do my own homework on its culture, among other things like self-hosting and defense in depth in terms of security and privacy.

The only probles here why I can't go full in would be the toxicity of the tech/open-source spaces and the same reason
why you still need to use Windows solely at work (bless anyone setting their dev environments in Windows containers).

### Why haven't you reviewed my merge request or email patch?

I'm so sorry. Life keeps getting in the way of me being a responsive maintainer, especially as neurodivergent getting hit
by the burnout bus and experiencing mental health struggles. Your hard work deserves better!
