## General

* Don’t leak nor spill beans on what shouldn’t be discussed, especially confidential and personal stuff.
* Read my personal user manual in full before you ask.
* For fandom-related stuff and other things, consider [reading my DNI](./dni.md)

## Personal

!!! note
    Looking for mental health parts, especially on neurodivergence/disability? You might be looking at [:material-wheelchair-accessibility::fontawesome-solid-brain: Neurodivergence and Disability](./neurodivergence-and-disability.md).

## Professional

## What happened when boundaries are disrespected?

Hopefully tantrums, meltdowns and shutdowns don’t happen in front of your own eyes in levels I can’t handle, especially the silent ones.

In most cases, I might be frustated

## What about your DNI (Do Not Interact) list?
