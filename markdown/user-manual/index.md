# Personal User Manual

!!! info "This website is currently the official mirror of my personal README over at Coda"
    In the future, I'll port things into this website to allow for community contributions without
    messing around doc permissions.

Hello there, and welcome to my personal user manual. This is where I document about myself for others in terms
of communications and teamwork. While the contents of this mini wiki will be always a work in progress, Iâ€™ll expand

## About me

I'm Andrei Jiroh, a Filipino 16-year-old junior high school student at day and Node.js and Deno backend developer at [Recap Time Squad](https://recaptime.eu.org) (technically not a legally-recognized company[^1] yet where I host most of my projects) and Linux + family IT sysadmin, resident Bash script kiddie on personal projects at home. I'm also happens to be a middle child while being neurodivergent, specifically I'm #ActuallyAutistic
