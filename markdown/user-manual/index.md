Hello there, and welcome to my personal user manual. This is where I document about myself for others in terms
of communications and teamwork. While the contents of this mini wiki will be always a work in progress, Iâ€™ll expand
them as I add missing information and update outdated details behind the scenes.

## About me

I'm Andrei Jiroh, a Filipino 16-year-old junior high school student at day and Node.js and Deno backend developer at [Recap Time Squad](https://recaptime.eu.org) (technically not a legally-recognized company[^1] yet where I host most of my projects) and Linux + family IT sysadmin, resident Bash script kiddie on personal projects at home. I'm also happens to be a middle child while being neurodivergent, specifically I'm [#ActuallyAutistic](https://autism-advocacy.fandom.com/wiki/ActuallyAutistic)[^2].
